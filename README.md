# Genetic Insights on Alzheimer's Disease Probability Prediction
This project aims to provide insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by analyzing genetic and clinical datasets to estimate each individual's probability of developing Alzheimer's. Leveraging genetic variations, clinical biomarkers, and advanced machine learning techniques, the project identifies significant genetic factors and calculates AD risk probabilities for a personalized approach to understanding genetic susceptibility.

# Introduction
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline. Genetic variations in specific alleles, particularly the APOE gene, have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's. This project explores these genetic factors and applies machine learning models to predict Alzheimer's risk by calculating individual probabilities based on genetic and clinical data.

# Project Overview
This project involves:

    Data Integration: Combining clinical data and genomic information for a comprehensive dataset.
    Risk Factor Identification: Mapping genetic variants, like APOE genotypes, to Alzheimer's risk.
    Probability Calculation: Training logistic regression and other models to assign an Alzheimer's probability score to each individual.
    Visualization: Detailed visualization of distributions, feature correlations, and Alzheimer’s probability predictions.

# Data Sources
    Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Data: Clinical records, including age, gender, BMI, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, are used to analyze health markers associated with Alzheimer's.
    Genome Data: Genetic data from the 1000 Genomes Project, with a focus on APOE genotype distributions and genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's.

# Methods
    Genotype Probability Calculation: Using population-based probabilities, the project assigns APOE genotypes to each individual and maps them to associated Alzheimer's risk.
    Risk Mapping: APOE genotypes are mapped to risk levels (low, intermediate, high) based on their probability of Alzheimer's.
    Feature Engineering: Calculated features, such as the Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, contribute additional biomarkers for risk assessment.

# Modeling and Prediction
    Logistic Regression Model: A logistic regression model is trained on clinical and genetic features to predict Alzheimer’s probability.
    Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness.
    Probability Prediction: Alzheimer’s probability scores are generated for each individual, highlighting risk levels.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis includes:

    Distribution Analysis: Histograms of clinical features (e.g., Age, BMI).
    Box Plots: For detecting outliers and assessing data quality.
    Correlation Matrix: For visualizing feature interrelationships and associations with Alzheimer's.
    Scatter and Violin Plots: To explore diagnosis relationships with features and probabilities.

# Results
The project outputs include:

    Alzheimer's Probability Scores: Individualized probability scores for Alzheimer's risk.
    Significant Variant Identification: Chi-square analysis to identify key genetic markers.
    Visualization of Findings: Histograms, scatter plots, and violin plots that showcase the data distribution and diagnosis associations.
